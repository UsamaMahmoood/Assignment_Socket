Get two computers in a LAN.

Run the server on one computer with:

./server.out
Get the IP of the server computer with ifconfig, e.g. 192.168.0.10.

On the other computer, run:

./client.out 192.168.0.10
Now type lines on the client, and the server will return them incremented by 1 (ROT-1 cypher).
